## How to Approach Math Problems

- Start with a **brute-force idea**
- Optimize using **mathematical observations**
- Look for:
  - Divisibility rules
  - Logarithmic reductions
  - Symmetry and patterns

---

## Interview Notes

- Math problems often test **logic**, not syntax
- Always consider **edge cases**:
  - `0`
  - Negative numbers
  - Large inputs
- Explain *why* a formula works, not just the result

---

## Learning Outcome

By completing this section, you will:
- Strengthen numerical intuition
- Improve logical reasoning
- Build confidence for coding interviews
