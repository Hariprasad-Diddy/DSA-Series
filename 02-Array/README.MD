# Arrays – DSA Series

## Overview
Arrays are the foundation of Data Structures and Algorithms.
Most interview problems start with array-based logic and pattern recognition.

This section covers the most important array patterns required to solve beginner to intermediate problems.

## Topics Covered
### 1. Traversal
Traversal means visiting each element of the array one by one.

Used for:
* Printing elements
* Counting occurrences
* Finding sum/product
* Checking conditions

Time Complexity: O(n)

### 2. Finding Minimum / Maximum
Finding smallest or largest element in an array.

Used for:
* Second largest element
* Range (max - min)
* Greedy logic

Time Complexity: O(n)

### 3. Prefix Sum
Prefix sum stores cumulative sums of elements.

Useful for:
* Subarray sum problems
* Range sum queries
* Efficient sum calculations

Time Complexity:
* Build prefix → O(n)
* Query → O(1)

### 4. Frequency Counting
Counting how many times each element appears.

Used for:
* Duplicates detection
* Majority element
* Hash-based optimizations

Time Complexity: O(n)

### 5. Two Pointers
Using two indices to solve problems efficiently.

Used for:
* Pair sum in sorted array
* Removing duplicates
* Merging arrays
* Partitioning problems

Time Complexity: O(n)

### 6. Sliding Window
Optimized way to handle subarray problems.

Used for:
* Maximum sum subarray of size K
* Longest substring with condition
* Variable window problems

Time Complexity: O(n)

### 7. Kadane’s Algorithm
Used to find maximum subarray sum.

Time Complexity: O(n)
